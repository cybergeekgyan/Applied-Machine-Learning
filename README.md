# Applied-Machine-Learning

Welcome to the Applied Machine Learning repository! 

This repository contains a collection of tutorials, notes, and resources for learning and applying machine learning techniques in real-world projects.


--> Applied machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on using algorithms and statistical models to enable computer systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. 

*In other words, it's about building and deploying practical machine learning solutions to solve real-world problems.*
